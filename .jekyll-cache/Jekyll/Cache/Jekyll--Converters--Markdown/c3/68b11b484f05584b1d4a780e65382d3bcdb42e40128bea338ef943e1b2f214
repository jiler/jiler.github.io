<p>A month ago, When I was trying to modify my articles named 《Summaries in the interviews and written tests in 2016 –XOR from 1 to 100》, I encountered some impedient in <a href="http://www.oschina.net/">“www.oschina.net”</a>, prompting that: some words are illegal. But I haven’t written words which contravening the laws of China.</p>

<p>Under the special state situation of my motherland, I desire to build my own blog to write technical articles freely and free of charge. I don’t think that a domain related with one’s name is cool, but studying the technique is under my encourgement.</p>

<p>Traditionally, studying procedure is a good matirial. Original contents thinks much better and significant, especially in English. Considering my English level, some chinese articles are inevitable.</p>
