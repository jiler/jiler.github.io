### Why I made my own blog on github

A month ago, When I was trying to modify my articles named 《Summaries in the interviews and written tests in 2016 --XOR from 1 to 100》, I encountered some impedient in ["www.oschina.net"][oschina], prompting that: some words are illegal. But I haven't written words which contravening the laws of China. 

Under the special state situation of my motherland, I desire to build my own blog to write technical articles freely and free of charge. I don't think that a domain related with one's name is cool, but studying the technique is under my encourgement.

### What will I write in the blog

Traditionally, studying procedure is a good matirial. Original contents thinks much better and significant, especially in English. Considering my English level, some chinese articles are inevitable.

### Summary

Any questions in my articles, you can contact with me through an email.
